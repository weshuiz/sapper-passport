It seems like the whole world 🌍 is using JWT for thier authentication. 🔐
JWT is just overkill for project with just 1 server.
So i decided to fix this problem by making this sapper example.

## installing

Clone or download this repo. 💾

```bash
npm install
```

to run the test server
```bash
npm run dev
```

And you're good to go.
Edit, modify, change to your heart's content 💙
